# Hi There! My name is Jonathan Lee.

This is my tentative portfolio, to display to potential employers who I am and what I do.
To summarize, I am a statistician that spends most of his time on the computer. I'm currently a Python fanatic,
but I also love functional programming languages like Haskell.

On this website, you'll find posts covering topics that I'm currently engrossed in. Most of these will pertain to the
subjects of artifical intelligence, but there may be some other stuff.

I have a download link for my resume, but if you're pressed for time, just take a look at my work experience, which I list below. Furthermore,
if you'd like there's also an html version on the site, as well links to my profile on sites like LinkedIn.
